<h1>Icelandic Forests in Viking Settlement Times</h1>
<strong>Believe it or not</strong>
<hr>

<p>

  When the Vikings came to this remote island in the North Atlantic Ocean the land was extensively forested.
   Around 1100 years ago the climate was warmer than it is now, and the glaciers were smaller than they are at the present time, even though there has been accelerating melting of the Icelandic glaciers for many decades.
    In even older times those glaciers were far smaller, the remains of a massive 3000-year-old forest have been discovered under Breiðamerkurjökull, a glacier tongue of Vatnajökull.
   So, there is now evidence that Iceland was even more heavily forested in older pre-settlement times than people had thought. Fossils, place names, the remnants of charcoal and climate modeling suggest that 25% to 40% of Iceland was forested when the Vikings came.
    In the light of new evidence, this figure should be raised considerably higher when referring to preceding millenniums.
